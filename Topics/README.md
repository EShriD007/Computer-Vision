Week 1: **Basics of 2D Image Formation & Processing**
**Theory:**
- Pin Hole Camera
- Perspective Projection
- Camera Modelling 
- Image Formation
- Color spaces (RGB, HSV, HSL, LAB, Grayscale, Binary)
- Convolution
- Gaussian convolution, bayesian Convolution, Median convolution

**Hands-on:**
- Implement image transformations (resize, rotate, affine & perspective transform)
- Apply convolution manually & compare with OpenCV

**Project:**
- Create a basic image enhancement tool with OpenCV

**Resources:**
- Richard Szeliskiâ€™s Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications (Chapter 1)
- OpenCV Tutorials - https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d9/df8/tutorial_root.html
